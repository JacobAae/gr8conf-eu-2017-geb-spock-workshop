= Part 4 - Testing goodreads.com/quotes

In this part of the workshop, you should do functional testing on a live website,
structuring your test code using Pages and Modules.

Start by clicking a bit around on https://www.goodreads.com/quotes[] and notice you can search for quotes using author,
tags or keywords.

Go to the QuotesSpec, where the first elements are set up for you, and implement the specs that
are predefined. Feel free to add more tests, but make sure you structure them nicely.
If you are using Pages and Modules correct, it should be quite easy to add another test scenario.

== Out of Work?

Make a test scenario that verifies the book section on goodreads.com also works,
or select your own favorite website/webapp and try to test it out using Geb and Spock :)
