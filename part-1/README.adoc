= Part 1 - Browser Automation

== The Task

Your task is the following:

. Make a list of all Grails 3 plugins in the format used in "The Grails Diary":

 <li><!-- ${lastUpdated} --><a href="${pluginLink}" target="_blank">${pluginTitle}</a> (${version}) ${description}.</li>

. Make a list of plugin publishers, and how many plugins they each have published.

== Getting Started

You should be able to run the Groovy script `plugins.groovy` as a stand alone script, and it should start a browser,
go to the Grails 3 plugin page and nothing more. The first time, dependency resolution might take a bit of time.

Start by locating the plugins section, and try to iterate over it, while gradually locating all the relevant information.
